# VestaBoard_Java_API

This is a Java API for working with virtual or physical VestaBoard boards. It is based on a Technology Innovation in Education (TIE) grant award by Mount Vernon Nazarene University's (MVNU) Online and Technology Committee. The goal is to use this API to create laboratory assignments for students in CS1 and CS2 (primarily) and then assess their engagement with a non-traditional output device.
